## Introduction

### Purpose

#### Background and Goals
The Book Tracker project was born from the shared idea of developing an innovative app that allows users to effortlessly manage their book collections. By integrating AI technologies, we aim to create a platform that can automatically recognize books by their covers and add them to virtual libraries. Our goal is to develop a user-friendly application that provides a personalized reading experience while optimizing and digitizing library management for book lovers.

## General Overview

### Current Situation Description
Our previous project experiences include working with databases for managing objects. In recent semesters, we have expanded our knowledge of Java and are applying our knowledge to the new programming language Kotlin. Additionally, past lectures have improved our understanding of software architectures and software design. The challenge of this project lies in training a model for image recognition to automatically capture book covers, as this is a new topic for all of us. This requires a thorough understanding of image processing techniques and machine learning. To build our project, we plan to integrate various APIs for book management, such as ISBNDB, Google Books, and OpenLibrary. Additionally, we use a dataset from Kaggle to train the image recognition model and improve its accuracy.

### Product Application

#### Application Areas
The developed Book Tracker app aims to provide users with an efficient way to manage their book collections. The main application areas include:
- **Private Use:** Individual users can use the app to organize their personal libraries, track their reading experiences, and receive recommendations based on their reading habits.
- **Educational Institutions:** Schools, universities, and educational institutions can use the app to manage access to books for students, make reading suggestions, and track reading progress.
- **Libraries and Bookstores:** Institutions such as libraries and bookstores can use the app to manage their own inventory, support customers in selecting books, and provide recommendations based on their users' interests.

#### Operating Conditions
The Book Tracker app is designed to be used under the following operating conditions:
- **Internet Connection:** The app requires an internet connection to retrieve information about books and utilize external APIs.
- **Lighting:** Adequate lighting is required for the image recognition and capture functions to ensure a clear capture of book covers.
